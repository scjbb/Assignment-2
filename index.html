                <p>
                <div class="PFormat"> Within the last 10 years, the world of entertainment has seen a massive shift in
                    terms of what
                    content is gaining views. Now you're probably thinking, “well yeah. Times change, technology
                    advances, why should I care”??</div>
                <div class="PFormat"> Because for the first time since its conception, the entertainment industry is
                    becoming accessible
                    to any lucky artist with the patience and knowledge to create good content. It's no secret that the
                    entertainment industry is competitive, the amount of hoops artists have to jump through just to get
                    in and get recognition has always served as a deterrence, a reason for parents to crush their
                    child's dreams of being an artist or actor.</div>
                <div class="PFormat">Any artist will tell you about how many times they've been told to ‘get a real
                    job’, or looked down
                    upon for wanting to work within a creative field, this is all caused by the negative stigma that
                    surrounds the entertainment industry. Up until recently, there was really no feasible way to work as
                    any type of artist unless you were willing to shift your life and gamble away anything and
                    everything, all for a small role in a low grade movie or an underpaid job as a background artist.
                    This all sounds incredibly depressing though, so let's move onto what changed, shall we??</div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="PFormat">The rise of the internet allowed artists a way to share their creations with the
                    world, all from the
                    comfort of home. Naturally, with the sudden influx of creatives eager to share their work with the
                    world came new platforms, programs, and technology capable of enabling artists to bring their
                    artistic visions to life, all without the need of a corporate company. This wild west known as the
                    independent artist scene eventually evolved into what it is today, a place where all you need to
                    share your ideas and projects are skill, time, patience, a device to work on, and a wifi connection.
                </div>

                <div class="PFormat">Sounds interesting right? Lets move onto the topic as a whole then: What are
                    independent projects?
                    Generally speaking, independent projects are typically projects an artist creates either out of love
                    and without any initial income from the project itself or crowd funded projects. Basically
                    independent projects are any piece of work created without backing from a corporation and or large
                    studio. The term “indie projects” cover a wide amount of media from video games to animations to
                    music to books, to really any artistic project inbetween, suffice to say independent projects are an
                    incredibly vast term.</div>
                <div class="PFormat">What's truly fascinating about indie projects is how and why these projects gain
                    popularity. The
                    answer as as to why varies from project to project, however a common answer lies within the content
                    itself. Its no secret that when a project gets picked up by a company, a fair amount of the original
                    content gets shifted and changed, mostly because of the risks that come with experimental media.
                    This issue is completely removed from the equation for indie projects, allowing the artist to create
                    complex, unique, and innovative content without anyone intervening and changing the artist's
                    original vision.</div>

                <div class="panel-title">A Basic History Of FNAF</div>
                <p>
                <div class="PFormat"> Now you may be wondering how exactly these indie projects are able to succeed
                    without the financial
                    backing of a corporation. For that, we need to take a look at a certain infamous franchise that
                    started with its small beginnings as an indie horror game that grew into a multi million dollar
                    franchise beloved by many.</div>
                <br>
                <br>
                <div class="PFormat">On october 27th, 2023, a movie titled Five Nights At Freddy’s was released in
                    theaters. On the surface, this movie may seem like a generic horror movie based on some game,
                    however upon further inspection, the franchise that this movie is based on is anything but generic
                    in terms of how it rose to prominence. In 2014 an indie game developer by the name of Scott Cawthon
                    released a horror game “titled Five
                    Nights at Freddy’s”, or Fnaf for short. In fnaf 1, you play as a security guard trying to survive
                    through the night while stuck in a Chuck. E. Cheese-esque pizza restaurant filled with fuzzy off
                    putting mascot animatronics who are determined to kill you before your 5 night short employment at
                    Freddy Fazbears Pizzaria ends. It sounds like a simple enough concept right? So how did we get to
                    the point where there was enough hype for a movie to be released about it?</div>
                <div class="PFormat">Well, let's talk about the gaming community on youtube for a second. Typically the
                    main way indie
                    games during the 2010’s could get exposure was when a youtuber with a large following played their
                    game, Fnaf was no different. Following its release fnaf slowly gained a small but consistent
                    following of fans, things remained generally consistent until a certain youtuber uploaded a
                    playthrough.</div>
                <div class="PFormat">On august 13th, 2014, a let's-play youtuber by the name of Markiplier uploaded his
                    first playthrough
                    of Fnaf. Mark’s large following was what skyrocketed the project and allowed Scott to upload Fnaf to
                    Steam, a popular site for buying games. The popularity of Fnaf is what allowed Scott to create Fnaf
                    2, which is around the time where it stopped being just a game and morphed into a full fledged
                    fandom. Youtubers like MatPat created theories while musicians like The Living Tombstone created fan
                    songs, sementing Fnaf’s place within internet infamy. Throughout the years games continued to be
                    released and fan content continued to help carry the fandom, although the popularity of Fnaf slowly
                    calmed down as most of the fans began to age out of the fandom.</div>
                <div class="PFormat">Now you may be wondering how this relates to the movie, and for that, we need to go
                    back to 2015.
                    The Fnaf franchise was popular, so much so that the sheer amount of content fans were creating was
                    almost enough to rival the Brony fandom at the time.That kind of love for an indie game was
                    something very few independent game developers could say at the time. The franchise was so much of
                    an instant success that Scott was offered a chance he couldn't refuse. About a year after Fnaf 1 was
                    released, It was announced that Vergo Entertainment had taken on the task of producing a Fnaf movie.
                    This announcement was huge within the fandom, it meant that this franchise that touched so many
                    people's hearts, would get the opportunity to grow and continue to produce content.</div>
                <div class="PFormat">This hope was fulfilled as games continued to be released, merchandise became
                    available in stores, and books containing lore were released. Many fans were ecstatic about the
                    influx of merchandise and content, although as time went on, fans started to wonder where the movie
                    was, considering updates were sporadic and development on the film was slow to say the least. The
                    main reason for this was related to the indecisiveness on things like the script and creative
                    decisions. I won’t go into the full extent of it, however if you’d like to know more about how the
                    movie’s production went, a link can be found <a

            <div class="panel" id="three-panel">
                <div class="panel-title">Why The Fans Loved The Franchise</div>
                <p>
                <div class="PFormat">Now that you know the general history of the game, let's talk about why the series
                    became so popular.
                    During the earlier years of the fandom, most of the appeal came from the idea itself, the
                    characters,
                    and the execution of it all. Looking at Fnaf 1 and 2 now, it's a little difficult to see how people
                    could find beauty in these musty looking robots, off putting sound design, and simplistic gameplay
                    mechanics. What made this fuzzy murder-bear horror game different from the hundreds of 1 hit wonder
                    jumpscare games that surrounded it?</div>
                <div class="PFormat">From personal experience as someone who was there, a common answer to this question
                    is tied to the
                    emotional attachment that players got from the characters. Now you might be wondering how exactly
                    people
                    could be emotionally attached to a story about child murderers and killer robots, and the answer
                    lies in
                    nostalgia and trauma.</div>

                <div class="PFormat">Let's talk about nostalgia first: have you ever been to Chuck. E. Cheese?
                    Regardless of
                    your answer, there's a good chance that the idea of a chuck e cheese is nostalgic and conflicting.
                    Fnaf
                    Theorist Youtuber <a href="https://youtu.be/ymmx_iY8aCU?si=AaFo3xapum78jEdh">NotRealName
                        NotAtAll</a>
                    describes the idea that the nostalgia from a mascot themed
                    restaurant is nostalgic because of the liminal feel it gives. I won't be going into detail about
                    liminal
                    spaces, mostly because of how extensive the topic is, but the main concept of what counts as a
                    liminal
                    space is basically a timeless looking, dreamlike, mildly off putting yet somehow comforting space
                    that
                    evokes feelings of unrealness and nostalgia. This describes the design of fnaf almost perfectly,
                    which
                    partially helped fans get attached to the world that we see within fnaf.
                    Now how exactly does this play into the emotional attachment fans have for these characters? For the
                    answer, we need to talk about how childhood trauma can manifest as an adult.
                </div>
                <div class="PFormat">If you'd allow me to set a scene, I’d like you to think back to your childhood and
                    think about what comforted you after a nightmare. If you had a stable childhood you might say
                    something
                    about how your caregiver comforted you and assured you when you were scared; however if you had a
                    rough
                    childhood your answer was probably something along the lines of how you learnt to comfort yourself.
                    As
                    humans, we don't have built in mechanisms to help us calm ourselves, that's a learned skill,
                    something
                    we’re either taught or forced to learn. For children who are forced to learn coping mechanisms
                    alone, a
                    common response is to get lost in one's own mind, how that manifests itself varies from person to
                    person. A scared child might make up an imaginary fuzzy animal friend to comfort them at night and
                    play
                    with them during the day, using escapism from a young age. An imaginary friend is what you make of
                    it, a
                    friend you created.</div>
                <div class="PFormat">The idea of having a goofy talking and singing fuzzy friend is a dream come true,
                    that's partially why mascot themed restaurants are still around today. Now if we look into Fnaf 1,
                    we
                    can see that most of the animatronics themself don’t show much of a real personality, they all play
                    the
                    part they're created to play, just surface level quirks that make up a characterture rather than a
                    real
                    character. This lack of personality made a perfect starting point for fans to interpret and fill in
                    the
                    gaps, essentially creating a personality from scratch, the same way a child would go about making up
                    an
                    imaginary friend.</div>
                <div class="PFormat">As the series continued, fans began to slowly create their own narrative for each
                    character, the complicated and confusing lore of the series allowed fans to interpret events in a
                    way
                    that fit within their own personal headcanons. The creativity that headcanons come with is enough to
                    get
                    attached to a character but what really helped is the violent and depressing aspects of the story.
                    If a
                    fan had issues with anxiety and abandonment issues, they might resonate with a character who is
                    depicted
                    as forgotten about, trauma bonding themself with this character and using it as a comfort character.
                </div>
                <br>
                <br>
                sun and moon
                <br>

                <div class="PFormat">A prime example of a Fnaf character that the fandom became emotionally attached to
                    is
                    the daycare attendant from Fnaf Security Breach. Within Security Breach the daycare attendant, also
                    known as Sun and Moon, has become such a popular character that fans of sun and moon have created
                    their
                    own mini fandom within the fnaf fandom. When Security Breach first came out it is incredibly obvious
                    that they didn't expect sun and moon to become as popular as they did, considering they only began
                    offering merchandise for him after months of fans asking for Sun and Moon merch.</div>
                <div class="PFormat">What caught people's attention about Sun and Moon was the concept and their design.
                    The
                    daycare attendant itself consists of 2 animatronics who share a body, 2 separate codes that switch
                    back
                    and forth based on the light level of the area. There's two main ways sun and moon are depicted,
                    those
                    two tropes are that one the caring attendant that supports the children, or the ticking time bomb
                    attendant whose one power outage away from murder. The idea of the caring daycare attendant is
                    charming:
                    one caretaker to run around and play games with the kids, the other to lul the little ones to sleep,
                    watch over and protect them from nightmares during naptime. The timebomb attendant is often shown
                    perceived as a jekyll and hyde type of character, which is more interesting rather than charming,
                    although fans still love to create angsty headcanons about the guilt they both might feel over those
                    they might have killed.</div>
                <div class="PFormat">To conclude this section, the basic point I wanted to get across is that the
                    emotional
                    attachment and comfort fans get from these characters is partially why so many fans continuously
                    come
                    back to this fandom. When the franchise started, what separated Fnaf from other horror games was the
                    community surrounding it, the fandom’s investment for the characters and story is what kept fans
                    entertained in between games, and that engagement is what popularized the fandom to what it is now.
                    Oddly enough, it's the love and comfort that people got from this horror game that allowed it to go
                    from
                    an idea Scott had one day to the multi million dollar franchise it is now, and that in itself is
                    somethingI find astonishing. After all, if Scott can do it, it sets up the idea that others can too.
